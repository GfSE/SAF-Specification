# Evidence Viewpoint
*Domain:* **Common** *Aspect:* **Structure**
## Example
*none*
## Purpose
The Common Evidence Pattern Viewpoint presents claim(s) backed up by argument(s) that are supported by evidence, together with the possibility to counter such claim(s) in a similar manner.
## Applicability
The Common Evidence Pattern Viewpoint supports the ability to present an evidence pattern, a structure of claim(s), argument(s) and evidence, which is a common need in systems engineering. It applies equally to the establishment of traceability, definition of safety cases and even the presentation of business cases.
