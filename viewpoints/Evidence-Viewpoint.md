# Evidence Viewpoint
*Domain:* [Common](../domains.md#Domain-Common) *Aspect:* [Structure](../aspects.md#Aspect-Structure)
## Example
*none*
## Purpose
The Common Evidence Pattern Viewpoint presents claims backed up by arguments that are supported by evidence, together with the possibility to counter such claims in a similar manner.
## Applicability
The Common Evidence Pattern Viewpoint supports the ability to present an evidence pattern, a structure of claim(s), argument(s) and evidence, which is a common need in systems engineering. It applies equally to the establishment of traceability, definition of safety cases and even the presentation of business cases.
## Stakeholder
## Concern
* How is a evidence-based claim supported?
