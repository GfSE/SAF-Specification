# System State Viewpoint
*Domain:* **Functional** *Aspect:* **Behavior**
## Example
![FFDS System Mode & State](../diagrams/FFDS-System-Mode-&-State.svg)
## Purpose
The System State Viewpoint defines the condition(s) of the SOI or parts of it that constrain the execution of System Function(s). A System State is a pre-condition or post-condition of a Use Case, or is used in Requirement(s). The valid transition(s) between System State(s) and the condition(s) for transitioning are specified.
