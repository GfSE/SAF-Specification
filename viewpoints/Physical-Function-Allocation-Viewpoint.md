# Physical Function Allocation Viewpoint
*Domain:* [Physical](../domains.md#Domain-Physical) *Aspect:* [Mapping & Crossreference](../aspects.md#Aspect-Mapping-&-Crossreference)
## Example
*none*
## Purpose
The Physical Function Allocation Viewpoint specifies the allocation of Function(s) to the Physical SOI element(s).
## Applicability
The Function Allocation Viewpoint supports the "System Architecture Definition process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015  .
## Stakeholder
* [Acquirer](../stakeholders.md#Acquirer)
* [Safety Expert](../stakeholders.md#Safety-Expert)
* [System Architect](../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
## Concern
* What is the allocation of functions to the physical architecture?
* Which functions and services need to be implemented in SW?
* Which functions need to be realized by HW?
## Presentation
A  Function  Allocation Matrix featuring
* the call behavior action representing usage of Function(s)
* the part property(s) representing usage of physical SOI Element(s)
