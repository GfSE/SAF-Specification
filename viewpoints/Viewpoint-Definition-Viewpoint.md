# SAF User Documentation : **D2_VPTD** Viewpoint Definition Viewpoint
|**Domain**|**Aspect**|**Maturity**|
| --- | --- | --- |
|[SAF Development](../domains.md#Domain-SAF-Development)|[Taxonomy & Structure](../aspects.md#Aspect-Taxonomy-&-Structure)|![Proposed](../diagrams/Under_construction_icon-red.svg )[proposed](../using-saf/maturity.md#proposed)|
## Example
![Viewpoint-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../diagrams/vp-examples/Viewpoint-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The Viewpoint Definition Viewpoint serves as a specification for any SAF viewpoints in the context of the development of SAF.
## Applicability
The ... Viewpoint supports the ...  in INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023.
## Presentation
A View and Viewpoints Diagram featuring one *SCM Viewpoint* Element, one *SCM_View* element, a *conform* relationship among them. Additionally all *SCM_Concept* elements that are of interest in the viewpoint. Additionally *expose* relationships for all concepts that help satisfy the viewpoints concerns.
Note, that the consequence of exposing a concept is, that the implementation of the concept must appear in the diagram/table/matrix that implements the viewpoint.
