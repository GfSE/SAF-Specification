## Example
![System-Interface-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../diagrams/vp-examples/System-Interface-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The System Interface Definition Viewpoint captures system wide concepts defining interfaces. It allows to adopt long-lived standards and to harmonize conceptual interface definitions to improve interchangeability, interoperability, and portability.
## Applicability
The System Interface Definition Viewpoint supports the "prepare for system requirement definition" activity part of the "System Requirements Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023 [ยง2.3.5.3] and contributes to the artifact "System Requirements Definition Report".

Furthermore, the viewpoint supports the "Interface Management" approach of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023 [ยง3.2.4].
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) featuring Conceptual Interface blocks with ports, and flow properties.

A tabular format listing Conceptual Interface blocks, their ports, and flow properties.
