## Example
![System-Interface-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../diagrams/vp-examples/System-Interface-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The System Interface Definition Viewpoint captures system wide concepts defining interfaces. It allows to adopt long-lived standards and to harmonize the interface definitions to improve interchangeability, interoperability, and portability.
## Applicability
The System Interface Definition Viewpoint supports the "Prepare for Interface Requirement Definition" activity included in "System Requirements Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง2.3.5.3] and contributes to the System Interface definition.
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) featuring System Interface blocks with ports, and flow properties.

A tabular format listing System Interface blocks, their ports, and flow properties.

## Stakeholder

* [IV&V Engineer](../stakeholders.md#IV&V-Engineer)
* [Security Expert](../stakeholders.md#Security-Expert)
* [Software Developer](../stakeholders.md#Software-Developer)
* [System Architect](../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
## Concern
* Which standards, protocols, and format specifications are associated with a specific interface?
