# System Functional Breakdown Viewpoint
*Domain:* [Functional](../domains.md#Domain-Functional) *Aspect:* [Structure](../aspects.md#Aspect-Structure)
## Example
![FFDS Function Breakdown Structure Definition](../diagrams/FFDS-Function-Breakdown-Structure-Definition.svg)
## Purpose
The System Functional Breakdown Viewpoint defines the functional hierarchy of the SOI beginning with identified System Function(s) further down to decomposed partial Function(s). The reuse of partial Function(s) over Function Trees of the SOI is demonstrated.
## Applicability
The System Functional Breakdown Viewpoint supports the "System Requirements Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง4.3] and contributes to the System Function Definition.
## Stakeholder
* [Acquirer](../stakeholders.md#Acquirer)
* [Customer](../stakeholders.md#Customer)
* [System Architect](../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
* [User](../stakeholders.md#User)
## Concern
* How are the system functions decomposed into sub-functions decomposed? 
* What is the breakdown of functions into sub-functions?
* Which functions will the system provide?
## Presentation
The result of the [tbd] process is one or more block definition diagram(s) (BDD) featuring [tbd].
