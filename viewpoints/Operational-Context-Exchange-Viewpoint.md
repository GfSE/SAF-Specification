## Purpose
The Operational Context Exchange Viewpoint provides the operational exchange of systems, personnel, information, material, energy, etc. between operational performers.
## Applicability
The Operational Context Exchange Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023 [ยง2.3.5.1] and contributes to both the problem or opportunity statement, and the Major Stakeholder Identification.
## Presentation
An internal block diagram (IBD) - associated to the operational context - featuring the interconnected operational performers in their respective operational role, and the operational item exchange per operational connection.

A tabular format listing [tbd].
