* fosters the communication among different Stakeholders
## Applicability
The Operational Story Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023 [ยง2.3.5.1] and contributes to the problem or opportunity statement.
## Presentation
A use case diagram featuring model elements representing operational stories, the context in they're taking place and operational performers involved. 
Note: Illustrations, drawings, sketches, etc., and/or descriptions in free text may provide a comprehensive understanding of the operational mission.
