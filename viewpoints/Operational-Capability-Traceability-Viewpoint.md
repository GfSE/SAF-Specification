## Example
![SAR and FDN Operational Capability Traceability Table](../diagrams/SAR-and-FDN-Capability-Traceability-Table.svg)
## Purpose
The Operational Capability Traceability Viewpoint describes the relationships of Operational Capabilities. The reasoning for Operational Capabilities as support for Operational Stories and contribution of Operational Processes to Capabilities is described.
## Applicability
The Operational Capability Traceability Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง 4.1], and contributes to the definition of Operational Capabilities.
## Stakeholder
## Concern
* Show in a concise manner the relationships from operational capability to operational story, to operational activity, and to operational performer.
## Presentation
The relationships of Operational Capabilities to Operational Stories, and to Operational Process Activities are represented in a table.
