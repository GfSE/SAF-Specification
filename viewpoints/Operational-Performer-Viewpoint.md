## Purpose
The Operational Performer Viewpoint represents the taxonomy of the identified Operational Performers, if existing and relevant for the understanding of the operation of the intended solution. 
## Applicability
The Operational Performer Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง 4.1] and contributes to the problem or opportunity statement.
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) featuring Operational Performers. and their relations in terms of decomposition or generalization at a level of detail required for problem understanding and analysis. 
Note: Identified Stakeholders are related to Operational Performers if appropriate.

A table containing operational performers, their inter relations  and relations to stakeholders
