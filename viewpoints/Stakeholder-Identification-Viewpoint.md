# Stakeholder Identification Viewpoint
*Domain:* **Operational** *Aspect:* **Structure**
## Example
*none*
## Purpose
The Stakeholder Identification Viewpoint in the Operation Domain strives to identify the operational Stakeholder(s) i.e. those stakeholders who’s need(s) must be considered during the operation of the intended solution and the execution of the operational processes to support the identified capabilities. During the realization of the intended solution and the system development additional Stakeholder(s) must be identified having additional need(s) and requirement(s) e.g. regarding production of system elements or certain technologies. 
A Stakeholder analysis is a process of identifying these individuals, teams, or organizations throughout the project life cycle, grouping them according to their levels of participation, interest, and influence in the project, and determining how best to involve and communicate with each of these Stakeholder groups throughout.
## Applicability
The Stakeholder Identification Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" and the "Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [§ 4.1, § 4.2] and contributes to the Major Stakeholder Identification.
Note:
## Stakeholder

## Concern
* What concerns does a Stakeholder have?
* In which life cycle(s) is a Stakeholder involved in the project?
* What are the requirement(s) that a Stakeholder imposes to the system?
* What are the consequences not considering a Stakeholder?
