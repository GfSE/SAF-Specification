## Example
![Logical-Functional-Mapping-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../diagrams/vp-examples/Logical-Functional-Mapping-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The Logical Functional Mapping Viewpoint captures the assignment of the System Functions and the System Partial Functions to the Logical SOI and the Logical SOI Elements.
## Applicability
The Logical Function Mapping Viewpoint supports the "System Architecture Definition process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง 4.4] and contributes to the System Architecture description.
## Presentation
A dependency matrix featuring
* the call behavior action representing usage of System Functions or System Partial Functions,
* the part properties representing usage of Logical SOI Elements,
* the allocation relationship between above mentioned elements.

## Stakeholder
* [Hardware Developer](../stakeholders.md#Hardware-Developer)
* [Software Developer](../stakeholders.md#Software-Developer)
* [System Architect](../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
## Concern
* Which functions are allocated to a Logical Element of the logical architecture?
## Profile Model Reference
The following Stereotypes / Model Elements are used in the Viewpoint:
* Allocate [SysML Profile]
* SAF_LogicalInternalRole contained in SAF_LogicalElement
* [SAF_FunctionAction](../stereotypes.md#SAF_FunctionAction)
* [SAF_LogicalElement](../stereotypes.md#SAF_LogicalElement)
* [SAF_LogicalSOI](../stereotypes.md#SAF_LogicalSOI)
* [SAF_SLV08a_View](../stereotypes.md#SAF_SLV08a_View)
* [SAF_SystemFunction](../stereotypes.md#SAF_SystemFunction)
* [SAF_SystemPartialFunction](../stereotypes.md#SAF_SystemPartialFunction)
