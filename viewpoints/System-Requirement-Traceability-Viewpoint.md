# System Requirement Traceability Viewpoint
*Domain:* **Functional** *Aspect:* **Crossreference and Mapping**
## Example
*none*
## Purpose
The System Requirement Traceability Viewpoint specifies [tbd]
For every SOI System Requirement the traceability to functional domain level is depicted
* System Story
* System Context Definition
* System Context Exchange
* System Functional Scenario
* System Context Interaction
is listed.
Note: new VP to be created addressing dedicated concern
[the traceability to operational domain level
* Operational Story
* Operational Context Definition
* Operational Context Exchange
* Operational Capability
* Operational Process
* Operational Interaction
* Stakeholder Requirement]
## Applicability
The System Requirement Traceability Viewpoint supports the "System Requirements Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง4.3] and contributes to the System Requirements Traceability. The System Requirement Traceability Viewpoint contributes to System Requirements Verification and Traceability Matrix (RVTM).
Note:
## Stakeholder
* [Customer](../stakeholders.md#Customer)
* [Regulation Authority](../stakeholders.md#Regulation-Authority)
* [Safety Expert](../stakeholders.md#Safety-Expert)
* [Security Expert](../stakeholders.md#Security-Expert)
* [System Architect](../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
## Concern
* Which System Interface is addressed by a System Requirement?
* Which System Function is addressed by a System Requirement?
* What is the rationale for this System Requirement?
* Which Stakeholder Requirements are addressed by a System Requirement?
## Presentation
A System Requirement Dependency Matrix featuring relationship(s) from every SOI System Requirement(s) to element(s) such as
* System Story
* System Context Definition
* System Context Exchange
* System Functional Scenario
* System Context Interaction
Referring to a Stakeholder Requirement the dependency relation is <<derive>>, otherwise <<refine>>.
