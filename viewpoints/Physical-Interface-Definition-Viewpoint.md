## Purpose
The Physical Interface Definition Viewpoint captures definitions for physical interfaces. It allows to adopt long-lived standards and to harmonize physical interface definitions to improve interchangeability, interoperability, and portability.
## Applicability
The Physical Interface Definition Viewpoint supports the "create system design" activity included in the "Design Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023 [ยง2.3.5.5] and contributes to the artifact "System Interface Definition".

Furthermore, the viewpoint supports the "Interface Management" approach of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023 [ยง3.2.4].
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) featuring Physical Interface blocks with ports, and flow properties. Compatibility between Physical Interface blocks is expressed by associations and association blocks. Physical Interface blocks may be specialisations of others (use of generalisation).
Note: When ports are used these shall be proxy ports and be typed by interface blocks.

A tabular format listing Physical Interface blocks, their ports, and flow properties.
