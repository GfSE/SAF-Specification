## Example

## Purpose
The System Functional Refinement Viewpoint analyses decomposition of System Functions into System Partial Functions in order achieve understanding and agreement about the System functions sufficient to derive system  requirements.
## Applicability
The System Functional Refinement Viewpoint supports the "Define System Requirements" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง4.3] defining System Functions level. The System Functional Refinement Viewpoint contributes to the System Function definition.
## Stakeholder
* [System Architect](../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
## Concern
* How are the system functions decomposed into sub-functions ? 
* What is the breakdown of functions into sub-functions?
## Presentation
Activity Diagram featuring System Partial Functions, functional exchange between partial functions. There are explicitely no Swimlanes and no allocations to structure.
