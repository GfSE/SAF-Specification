## Example
![System-Functional-Refinement-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../diagrams/vp-examples/System-Functional-Refinement-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The System Functional Refinement Viewpoint analyses decomposition of System Functions into System Partial Functions in order achieve understanding and agreement about the System functions sufficient to derive system  requirements.
## Applicability
The System Functional Refinement Viewpoint supports the "Define System Requirements" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง4.3]. The System Functional Refinement Viewpoint contributes to the System Function definition.
## Presentation
Activity Diagram featuring System Partial Functions, functional exchange between partial functions. There are explicitely no Swimlanes and no allocations to structure.

## Stakeholder
* [System Architect](../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
## Concern
* [How are the system functions decomposed into smaller, and more manageable sub-functions? ](../concerns.md#_2021x_2_8710274_1674576758790_775644_23272)
* [What is the breakdown of functions into sub-functions?](../concerns.md#_2021x_2_8710274_1674576758728_463822_23204)
