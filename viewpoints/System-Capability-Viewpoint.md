## Example
![FFDS Capability Definition](../diagrams/FFDS-Capability-Definition.svg)
## Purpose
The System Capability Viewpoint defines a taxonomy of Capabilities including composition, specialization, and dependency relationships between System Capabilities.
## Applicability
The System Capability Viewpoint supports the "Requirement Definition" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง] defining System Capabilities at a system level . The System Capability Viewpoint contributes to Requirements definition.
## Stakeholder
* [Acquirer](../stakeholders.md#Acquirer)
* [Supplier](../stakeholders.md#Supplier)
* [System Architect](../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
## Concern
* What are the capabilities that are supported by the system?
## Presentation
A BDD featuring System Capabilities and their composition, specialization and dependency relationships. The relationship to operational capabilities shall be shown if applicable.

A Table featuring system capabilities, and their composition specialisation and dependency relationships, as well as relations to operational capabilities.
