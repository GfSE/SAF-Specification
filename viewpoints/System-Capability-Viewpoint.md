# System Capability Viewpoint
*Domain:* **Functional** *Aspect:* **Structure**
## Example
![FFDS Capability Definition](../diagrams/FFDS-Capability-Definition.svg)
## Purpose
The System Capability Viewpoint defines a taxonomy of Capability(s) including composition, specialization, and dependency relationship(s) between System Capability(s).
## Applicability
The System Capability Viewpoint supports the "[tbd]" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง] defining System Capability(s) at a system level (e.g. [tbd] and functional process(es)). The System Capability Viewpoint contributes to [tbd].
Note:
## Stakeholder
* [Acquirer](../stakeholders.md#Acquirer)
* [Customer](../stakeholders.md#Customer)
* [System Architect](../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
* [User](../stakeholders.md#User)
## Concern
* What are the Capability(s) that are supported by the SOI?
## Presentation
The result of the [tbd] process is one or more block definition diagram(s) (BDD) featuring System Capability(s) and their composition, specialization and dependency relationship(s).
