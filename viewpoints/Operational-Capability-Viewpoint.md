## Example
![SAR and FDN Capability Definition](../diagrams/SAR-and-FDN-Capability-Definition.svg)
## Purpose
The Operational Capability Viewpoint defines a taxonomy of Capabilites from a Stakeholder’s perspective including composition, specialization, and dependency relationships between Operational Capabilities.
## Applicability
The Operational Capability Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [§ 4.1] defining Capabilities at an operational level (e.g., business or mission profile, and operational scenarios). The Operational Capability Viewpoint contributes to the problem or opportunity statement.
## Stakeholder
* [Customer](../stakeholders.md#Customer)
* [Portfolio Manager](../stakeholders.md#Portfolio-Manager)
## Concern
* What operational Capabilities are required for each phase and mode of operation?
* What operational capabilities are defined?
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) featuring Operational Capabilities, and their composition, specialization, and dependency relationships.
