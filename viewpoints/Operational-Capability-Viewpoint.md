# Operational Capability Viewpoint
*Domain:* **Operational** *Aspect:* **Structure**
## Example
![SAR & FDN Capability Definition](../diagrams/SAR-&-FDN-Capability-Definition.svg)
## Purpose
The Operational Capability Viewpoint defines a taxonomy of Capability(s) from a Stakeholder’s perspective including composition, specialization, and dependency relationship(s) between Operational Capability(s).
## Applicability
The Operational Capability Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [§ 4.1] defining Capability(s) at an operational level (e.g. business or mission profile and operational scenarios). The Operational Capability Viewpoint contributes to the problem or opportunity statement.
Note:
## Stakeholder
* [Acquirer](../stakeholders.md#Acquirer)
* [Customer](../stakeholders.md#Customer)
* [Supplier](../stakeholders.md#Supplier)
* [System Architect](../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
## Concern
* What Operational Capability(s) are required for each phase and mode of operation?
* What is the lack / deficiency / gap in current Capability implementation that is addressed with the intended solution?
## Presentation
The result of the business and mission analysis is one or more block definition diagram(s) (BDD) featuring Operational Capability(s) and their composition, specialization and dependency relationship(s).
