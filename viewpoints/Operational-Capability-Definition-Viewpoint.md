## Example
![Operational-Capability-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../diagrams/vp-examples/Operational-Capability-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The Operational Capability Definition Viewpoint defines a taxonomy of Capabilities from a Stakeholder’s perspective including composition, specialization, and dependency relationships between Operational Capabilities.
## Applicability
The Operational Capability Definition Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023 [§ 2.3.5.1] defining Capabilities at an operational level (e.g., business or mission profile, and operational scenarios). The Operational Capability Viewpoint contributes to the problem or opportunity statement.
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) featuring Operational Capabilities, their composition, specialization, and dependency relationships.
