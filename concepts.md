A goal is defined as an end state that a Stakeholder intends to achieve. Goals are generally expressed using qualitative words; e.g., “increase”, “improve”, or “easier”. Goals can also be decomposed; e.g., “increase profit” can be decomposed into the goals “reduce cost” and “increase sales”. However, it is also very common to associate concrete objectives with goals, which can be used to describe both the quantitative and time-related measures which are essential to describe the desired state, and when it should be achieved.

## System Capability
exposed in viewpoint [System Capability Viewpoint](viewpoints/System-Capability-Viewpoint.md)

realized by Stereotype [SAF_SystemCapability](stereotypes.md#SAF_SystemCapability)

1) A System capability is an operation or task that performs an action to produce a specific performance-based outcome. Note that a system capability represents the potential to perform an action. In contrast, an operational capability may integrate several physical system capability(s) to produce a specific outcome to achieve a mission objective. [Wasson2006, SystemAnalysis+Design+Development]
2) System capability(s), as system assets, characterize the mechanical, electrical, optical, or processing features that enable a system to function, process mission resources, make decisions, and achieve a required level of success based on performance. A system capability is broader in scope than simply a functional element (and performance bounding elements), especially in large, complex ecosystems. It represents a physical potential - strength, ability, endurance - to perform an outcome-based action for a given duration under a specified set of operating environment condition(s). [Wasson2006, SystemAnalysis+Design+Development]
