The argument used depends on the type, trustworthiness and extent of available evidence and the nature of the claim. | . | Evidence | An evidence is an artifact that establishes facts that can be trusted and lead directly to a claim. In projects there can many sources of information, but what makes this evidence is the support or rebuttal it gives to a claim. | . | Claim | A claim is a true/false statement about a property of a particular object. A claim is just what you might consider it to be from common usage of the term; an idea that someone is trying to convince somebody else is true. An example claim could be made on a train, e.g., the train is safe. | . | Subject of Claim | Note: A claim cannot be generic, it has to be about something, it has to have a defined subject, e.g., system safety. | . | EVCreinforcingAGT | Specifies the fact that an argument is reinforced by one or more evidence via a argument-evidence relation. | . | CLTmakingCLM | Specifies the fact that a claim is made by a defined claimant. | . | CounterClaim | A party's claim is a counter-claim if one party asserts claims in response to the claims of another. | . | CLMbeingMadeAboutSBC | Specifies the fact that a claim is made about an identified subject matter. | . | Claimant | A party asserting claims. | . | CCMcounteringCIM | Specifies the fact that any claimable item, e.g., claim, argument, and evidence, is countered by one or more claims. | . | CLMsupportingCIM | Specifies the fact that any claimable item, e.g., claim, argument, and evidence, is supported by one or more claims. | . | AGTsupportingCLM | Specifies the fact that a claim is supported by one or more arguments via a claim-argument relation. | . | Refuter | A party asserting counter-claims. | .

The argument used depends on the type, trustworthiness and extent of available evidence and the nature of the claim. | . | CounterClaim | A party's claim is a counter-claim if one party asserts claims in response to the claims of another. | . | Evidence | An evidence is an artifact that establishes facts that can be trusted and lead directly to a claim. In projects there can many sources of information, but what makes this evidence is the support or rebuttal it gives to a claim. | . | EVCreinforcingAGT | Specifies the fact that an argument is reinforced by one or more evidence via a argument-evidence relation. | . | Claimant | A party asserting claims. | . | Refuter | A party asserting counter-claims. | . | CLMbeingMadeAboutSBC | Specifies the fact that a claim is made about an identified subject matter. | . | Subject of Claim | Note: A claim cannot be generic, it has to be about something, it has to have a defined subject, e.g., system safety. | . | CLTmakingCLM | Specifies the fact that a claim is made by a defined claimant. | . | CLMsupportingCIM | Specifies the fact that any claimable item, e.g., claim, argument, and evidence, is supported by one or more claims. | . | CCMcounteringCIM | Specifies the fact that any claimable item, e.g., claim, argument, and evidence, is countered by one or more claims. | . | AGTsupportingCLM | Specifies the fact that a claim is supported by one or more arguments via a claim-argument relation. | . | RFTmakingCCM | Specifies the fact that a counter-claim is made by a defined refuter. | . | Argument Decomposition | This argument concept is used to claim that a conclusion about the whole object or property can be deduced from the claims or facts about constituent parts. Decomposition argument blocks can also be used to incorporate defeaters into the case. | . | Argument Substitution | This argument concept is used to claim that if a property holds for one object, then it holds for an equivalent object. Similarly, if a property holds for some object, then an equivalent property will also hold for the same object. The nature of the equivalence will vary with the object and property and will need to be defined. | . | Argument Concretion | This argument concept is used when a claim needs to be given a more precise definition or interpretation. | .

[Wasson2006, SystemAnalysis+Design+Development] 2) System Capabilities, as system assets, characterize the mechanical, electrical, optical, or processing features that enable a system to function, process mission resources, make decisions, and achieve a required level of success based on performance. A system capability is broader in scope than simply a functional element (and performance bounding elements), especially in large, complex ecosystems. It represents a physical potential - strength, ability, endurance - to perform an outcome-based action for a given duration under a specified set of operating environment conditions.

It is okay to assign several Logical Elements to one Physical Element. This means all specified functionality assigned to the Logical Elements is to be implemented by the Physical Element.

Note: Connecting capabilities to requirements creates a linkage between two different types of conceptual problem description that helps manage the complexity of the system. At a high level of abstraction, capabilities allow an system architect to plan phases of the system evolution without the need to bear details in mind. Those details will not be lost if they are captured as requirements and traced to a corresponding capability. There is one key difference between capabilities and requirements: Requirements come from different sources, sponsored by different stakeholders, and are usually captured at different levels of abstraction. In contrast, capabilities should always represent a coherent and consolidated view of the system. ",

A System Use Case is only the abstract of the depicted System behavior and represents the purpose. While the main System of Interest interaction actors participating in this Use Case are identified, the behavior itself is specified by a Use Case Activity, Note: The intended use (and also misuse in so called \"black use cases\") of the System of Interest is captured in free text; story telling at a coarse level of detail which is understandable to Customers (non engineering stakeholders in general). | . | System Function | Specifies the fundamental action or task that have to take place in the System in accepting and processing the inputs and in processing and generating the outputs. A System Function * accepts input from the System boundary * exposes its output at the System boundary * changes the System's State * is dependent on System's State Note: A System Function does not need to expose observable output, when it changes the System's state in a way that is observable by other system functions. Furthermore, a System Function does not need to accept any input from the system boundary, when it is dependent on the System State, which in turn is changeable by other System Functions. | . | Logical Interaction Point | Specifies the existence of an interaction point on Logical Level. | . | System Process | Specifies the fact that a System Process captures system behavior as a specific sequence of actions or tasks, and system exchanges including information, materials, energy, etc. | . | System Function in System Process | Specifies the fact that a System Function is used in a System Process. | . | refining | Specifies the fact that a System Use Case is refined by one System Process. | . | System Capability | 1) A System Capability is an operation or task that performs an action to produce a specific performance-based outcome. NOTE that a system capability represents the potential to perform an action. In contrast, an operational capability may integrate several physical system capabilities to produce a specific outcome to achieve a mission objective. [Wasson2006, SystemAnalysis+Design+Development] 2) System Capabilities, as system assets, characterize the mechanical, electrical, optical, or processing features that enable a system to function, process mission resources, make decisions, and achieve a required level of success based on performance. A system capability is broader in scope than simply a functional element (and performance bounding elements), especially in large, complex ecosystems. It represents a physical potential - strength, ability, endurance - to perform an outcome-based action for a given duration under a specified set of operating environment conditions. [Wasson2006, SystemAnalysis+Design+Development] Aliases: UAF::Capability NAF4::Capability | . | SRrefiningSCY | Specifies the fact that a System Capability is refined by System Requirements. | . ",

NOTE that a system capability represents the potential to perform an action. In contrast, an operational capability may integrate several physical system capabilities to produce a specific outcome to achieve a mission objective. [Wasson2006, SystemAnalysis+Design+Development] 2) System Capabilities, as system assets, characterize the mechanical, electrical, optical, or processing features that enable a system to function, process mission resources, make decisions, and achieve a required level of success based on performance. A system capability is broader in scope than simply a functional element (and performance bounding elements), especially in large, complex ecosystems. It represents a physical potential - strength, ability, endurance - to perform an outcome-based action for a given duration under a specified set of operating environment conditions.

The SAF example model SAF_FFDS.mdzip is a System Model. | SAF_Profile Model This is a model needed to create a SAF System Model. It is tool specific and (hopefully) compliant to the SAF Specification. There currently several contributed models. Some of the Repositories also contain an example System Model. Please head over to Tool Implementations. | SAF_Specification Model The specification model contains the definitions serving as foundation for SAF development. See the following chapter for details. | SAF_SCM_Profile Model The SAF SCM Profile is used by the SAF_Specification model.

    "content": "The conceptual model is the foundation of SAF development. It governs, which items SAF consist of and how these items are related. It follows the concepts of ISO 42010. SAF extends ISO 42010 in a way that SAF is able to express a rationale for a Stakeholders Concern. Core Concepts . Within the conceptual model the following elements can be recognized (many of them are specializations of ISO 42010 Concepts): . | SAF Architecture Framework Stakeholders are classes of users having an interest on the information that is maintained in a SAF System Model. | SAF Architecture Framework Concerns sketch out the information need of SAF Architecture Framework Stakeholders. The SAF Frameworks Viewpoints shall be designed in a way to frame these concerns, and in the end the information need should be adressed by a SAF System Model using the appropriate SAF Viewpoints. | SAF Rationale expains why a SAF Architectur Framework Stakeholder has abovementionend information need resulting in a SAF Architecture Framework Concern. This is currently not covered by ISO 42010. | SAF Concepts are the conceptual definition of items and their relationships forming an information network to be kept in a SAF System Model, in order to give answers to the SAF Architecture Framework Stakeholders Concerns. | SAF Viewpoints select a set of SAF Concepts in order to adress the information need expressed by a certain set of abovementioned Stakeholers Concerns. In SAF the size of Viewpoints should be optimized to support tailoring by selection of viewpoints appropriate to the engineering problem at hand. This means that SAF Viewpoints should adress only a small number of well defined Concerns. | SAF Information Items are like SAF Viewpoints but at a larger scale. They can group SAF Viewpoints while constraining them further. They also can be nested. This allows to specify Information Items like e.g. an ISO 29148 SyRS by breaking it down into smaller Information Items and finally into Viewpoints. This allows to define which concerns are to be adressed e.g. by a SyRS document and which viewpoints are needed for it. They also could be used to plan work items in order to plan a MBSE effort. The goal is, to precisely define the needed model work for certain points in an engieering project. | . Details are documented in the metamodeling guide. ",

    "content": "The backbone of the SAF is the SAF Metamodel. The SAF Metamodel is dedicated to model based systems engineering and reflects the SE ontology in this domain. It ensures the inherent consistency of the system of interests’ model generated according to the SAF. The SAF Metamodel consists of two specialized models: the abstract SAF Conceptual Model describing the concepts used in the systems engineering domain, and the Viewpoints of SAF and the SAF Profile Model focusing on the implementation of those concepts in a profile. The SAF Profile Model serves as a specification for any SAF Profile Implementations in Modelling Tools. Both Model parts are captured in the Tool MagicDraw. (This is a decision of the SAF Working group – it could have been any Tool) . For defining terms used in the SAF and assuring the consistency across their usage in the architecture description, the SAF Conceptual Metamodel (SCM) is used. The SCM defines the terms and concepts used and the relations between them. These terms and concepts match with common understanding as described by ISO15288 and INCOSE handbook. The SCM specifies WHAT is captured in the system of interests model. It is limited to the scope of what is considered in the SAF and is not a complete description of all the concerns of systems engineering. SCM also specifies the views (diagrams, tables, matrixes and other work products) that could be generated and their content i.e. the concept model elements and information contained on a diagram, or the queries on the model generating a view content. The second metamodel, the SAF Profile Model (SPM), depicts HOW the terms and concepts together with their relations are defined the SAF using the SysML modelling language. The SPM identifies which SysML Elements and sterotypes are to be used to represent the system architecture and their organization in the model repository. The SPM traces back to the SCM for compliance demonstration. The specific system model contains the views, which are specified by the SCM, using the SysML Elements and Sterotypes specified by SPM to capture information about the system and its surrounding. Based on the SPM the tool specific extensions, i.e. the profiles, are provided. The SCM is independent from tools and SysML language version, while implementations of the SPM depend on the SysML language verion and to a certain degree to the implementation of the SysML standard in available tools and their possibility to automate the modelling, model validation or document generation. For defining the SCM and the SPM only a few simple model elements are used to ease understanding, clarity, portability and exchange. These elements are defined in the following. ",

    "title": "Model Elements in the SAF Conceptual Model (SCM)",
    "content": "Rule: You shall not add attributes and types to concepts. Rule: Every conceptual item shall be described. See the actual Documentation of the concept elements for more examples of use. Following model elements are used in the SAF Conceptual Model. Classes . Classes stereotyped as «SCM_Concept» represent any concept or term in the SAF Conceptual Model (SCM). Example: . The following rules apply: . | Every class needs a description. | No attributes are modelled, put everything in the description. | . Generalization . Inheritance i.e. generalization / specialization relations are used to indicate that a specific concept is a kind or a variant of a more general concept. Following semantics apply: . | The general concept is used in the model to represent the set of different variants of that kind. | Whenever the general concept is used in the model, it may be replaced with one of the more specific concepts. | Any property or relation defined for the general concept applies for the specific concepts as well. | Any property or relation defined for the specific concept does not apply to the general concept nor to the other specific concepts of the same kind. | Avoid overly complicated inheritance. Sometimes using a constraint may be more appropriate. | . Example: . A Format Specification is a kind of Technical Standard and has all the attributes and properties of the Technical Standard but may define additional properties. The Protocol Definition is also a Technical Standard but has different properties as the Format Specification. The Format Specification and the Protocol Definition are both issued by a Standardization Body, but only the Protocol Definition can encapsulate further protocol definitions. Abstract Concepts . Note, that a concept can be marked as “Abstract”. This means that the abstract concept is not used directly but typically inherited concepts are used. Also see Generalization. Example: . Rule: Use abstract metamodel items if appropriate. Rule: Do not expose abstract concepts. Composition and Aggregation . Composition and Aggregation relationships are not used. Use undirected associations instead. Rule: Do not use composition or aggregation. Associations . Undirected associations are used to model the relations between two concepts. They get the stereotype «SAF_Concept». Example: . The Concept A has a relationship to Concept B. Rule: Use only undirected association . Naming of Associations . The name for the association indicates how the two concepts are related. The reading direction of the association name is necessary to understand the semantics, and must be set. One should be able to assemble a sentence like: . “Concept A” “has relation with” “Concept B”. Rule: Name every association. Rule: Use direction arrow on association name. Multiplicity . For the sake of simplicity, the multiplicity at both ends of the association may be used as appropriate. It is preferred to specify the multiplicities explicitly. Example: . In this example case a Physical System Context contains at least one, but maybe more Context elements. However, the Context Element may be used in several Physical System Contexts, or not at all. Role Names . Role names at the ends of the association are usually not used. However, in some cases it is necessary to distinguish roles, especially if the same concept is involved in different roles. In these cases, the role names are mandatory. Example: . The example shows a Concept “State”, and the relationship between “State” in the role “sourceState” and the role “targetState”. Association Classes . If the Association represents a valuable concept; it may be worth to model it as an association class. Since an association class can be part of other associations, an association class may be the only way to express elaborated concept relationships. Rule: Do not display the SCM_Concept stereotype at the relation - it is already in the class symbol . Rule: Do not display the name at the relation - it is already in the class symbol . Example: . In the example a Requirement refines a state transition of a state model. Derived Relationships . In SAF certain viewpoints represent analysis results from queries spanning several concepts and their relationships. E.g. A viewpoint could compute a requirement to state mapping by following the relations from “requirement” over “transits to state” to “state”. In order to specify such queries, a new derived relationship between state and requirement is drawn and marked by the stereotype «SCM_derived_relationship». The description of the derived relationship must contain sufficient information how the information is to be derived. Example: . Since SAF is customizable in terms of “skipping” viewpoints and taking “shortcuts”, a viewpoints specification may change a derived relationship into a defining relationship. Regarding the abovementioned example this would mean, if no transitions were in the model, it would be allowed to trace requirements to states manually, instead to have the relationship computed from the model. It is up to a viewpoint specification to define such constraints. Rule: Redundancy is fine . Redundant relationships can show different perspectives on information that can be derived from the model. It should then be specified which information is derived. Having seemingly redundant relationships can avoid hard understanding constraints. Constraints . Constraints should be used to express restrictions to concepts. Sometimes a simple constraint can avoid an overly complex inheritance hierarchy. Care should be taken to balance the overall readability of the SAF Conceptual Model. Example for constraints XOR One or the other but not both (mutual exclusion) . Rule: Use constraints sparsely, only easy constraints, but use them if necessary. Comments and Notes . Comments and notes may be placed on a diagram and may be anchored to each element or relation in the conceptual model. Use Notes for explanation, use comments only for model management. Example: . Graphical Elements . The conceptual model is important for communication. Therefore, the diagrams may contain additional graphical elements like dashed boxes or coloured boxes to support the understanding of the concepts. In the Example, a dashed box is used to separate logical and functional concepts. ",

SAF partitions the amount of modeling work for e.g. a whole system architecture into smaller parts, which each deliver value for stakeholders of the architecture by satisfying their information needs. Viewpoints satisfying Information Needs . These smaller parts are called viewpoints. They each serve a certain purpose, adress stakeholders concerns by presenting stakeholders a subset of the whole model. Viewpoints used to plan and partition work . This allows to partition and plan the work on the MBSE effort according to the problem at hand and helps to focus to the most important parts of the work. A MBSE approach can be planned by defining which viewpoints must be worked on in which phase of the MBSE effort, and it also could prioritize work or define different depths of elaboration for the viewpoints to work on. Because of this, SAF helps to execute an MBSE effort by a plan which is backed by reasoning about the information need of stakeholders. Viewpoints guide modeling effort to deliver stakeholder value . The viewpoints specify, which model elements shall be created in which kind of diagrams to serve the viewpoints purpose and adress the concerns of the stakeholders interested in the viewpoints.

Define the System Boundary . | Start by defining the System Of Interest(SOI) and then, users, environmental influences, and other systems to which the SOI will interface, using the System Context Definition Viewpoint . The goal here is, to dissect what is within the system from what is outside. | Define one or more system contexts, and bind the system and the abovementioned external elements to that context as appropriate. Multiple contexts allow to have different sets of context elements, and later different sets of use cases happening within these contexts. This allows an early divide and conquer approach. Examples for contexts could be: factory test, shipping, operational, or workshop maintainance. | . Tell Stories about System Usage . | Using the contexts and context elements defined earlier, create system use cases, using the System Use Case Viewpoint . The goal is, to tell the most important stories about the system happening in the contexts, and which key interactions with users, other systems or the environment happen during these stories. There is no need to use formal language, or a structured text approach - SAF has a specific System Process Viewpoint to refine Use Cases formally. However, if there are important system states as a precondition or as a result (postcondition) of a Use Case, they should be defined on the fly using the System State Viewpoint and recorded in the Use Case. Please note, that it should be avoided to put information items on the associations. Overly complex relationships among use cases should also be avoided. | . Refine Use Cases, identify need for System Functions, define need for exchange at the system boundary . | For each Use Case create a system process using the System Process Viewpoint. The system process translates the use case text into a formal model covering the paths through the Use Case. The exchanges of the system with external elements are covered and the expectations what external elements do and what the system shall do are identified. The goal is to first identify the need for System Functions and the need for exchange with external elements, and then define the System Functions from the consolidated needs. Since multiple System Processes from multiple contexts might (and usually will) call for the same or similar system functions, the necessity for a consolidation of system function definitions and usage on the level of system processes is given. The consolidation of System Functions is assisted by the System Functional Breakdown Structure Viewpoint. This viewpoint also gives an overview about the functional tree of the system and the usages of System Functions in System Processes. For the definition of exchanged items, use the System Domain Item Kind Viewpoint. If system states are preconditions for the execution of System Functions use the System State Viewpoint to define them.
