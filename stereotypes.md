At a high level of abstraction, capabilities allow an system architect to plan phases of the system evolution without the need to bear details in mind. Those details will not be lost if they are captured as requirements and traced to a corresponding capability. There is one key difference between capabilities and requirements: Requirements come from different sources, sponsored by different stakeholders, and are usually captured at different levels of abstraction.

It provides the basis for further assessment of the architecture candidates by identifying the system elements in each candidate solution.<BR>Note: It may be pointed out, that the physical architecture shall consider reuse, organizational, management and logistics support aspects.
