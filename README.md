# SAF Specification Source

If you want to read the documentation of the System Architecture Framework (SAF), please head over to [saf.gfse.org](https://saf.gfse.org)

We have changed the way the documentation is generated, and this is now the source repository for the automatic document generation process.

This is the main branch that reflects the current state of development and it is updated as required.

The former SAF releases are still available, in the legacy documentation format in separate branches:
* [Initial Release](https://github.com/GfSE/SAF-Specification/tree/Initial-Release/README.md)
* [TdSE2022](https://github.com/GfSE/SAF-Specification/tree/TdSE2022/README.md)
* [TdSE2023](https://github.com/GfSE/SAF-Specification/tree/TdSE2023/README.md)
* [snapshot oct 2024](https://github.com/GfSE/SAF-Specification/tree/legacy-doc/README.md)
