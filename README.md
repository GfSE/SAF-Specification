# SAF Specification Source
If you would like to read the System Architecture Framework (SAF) documentation, please visit [saf.gfse.org](https://saf.gfse.org)

We have changed the way the documentation is generated and github is now the source repository for an automatic document generation process. The main branch reflects the current state of development and will be updated as needed. The earlier SAF releases are still available in the legacy documentation format in separate branches:

* [Initial Release](https://github.com/GfSE/SAF-Specification/tree/Initial-Release/README.md)
* [TdSE2022](https://github.com/GfSE/SAF-Specification/tree/TdSE2022/README.md)
* [TdSE2023](https://github.com/GfSE/SAF-Specification/tree/TdSE2023/README.md)
* [snapshot oct 2024](https://github.com/GfSE/SAF-Specification/tree/legacy-doc/README.md)
