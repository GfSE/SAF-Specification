# SAF Specification Dev Branch
This is the System Architecture Framework specification. **It is work in progress.**

The Fire Forest Detection example, SAF_FFDS, is based on the publication **SYSMOD - The Systems Modeling Toolbox, 3rd edition Pragmatic MBSE with SysML, Tim Weilkiens**

# Viewpoint Grid
The Viewpoints are organized a Grid, havin **Domains** as rows and **Aspects** as columns

![SAF Grid](diagrams/SAF_FFDS_view_grid.svg)

The subsequent chapters give an overview over the SAF viewpoints.

There are also [specifications of the view points in PDF ](./pdfs)format.

## Operational Domain

### Operational Domain Objective

The SAF Operational Domain aims to get an understanding of required organizational or operational entity capability(s), as a foundation for to systems to be acuired or developed. The viewpoints of the SAF Operational Domain assist the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" and the "Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง 4.1, ยง 4.2].

The SAF Operational Domain supports the model-based development of a [CONOPS](https://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/Concept_of_Operations_(ConOps)_(glossary)) - as well as an [OPSCON](https://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/Business_or_Mission_Analysis) and related life cycle concepts - for an organization or operational entity seeking for an improvement of existing capability(s) or in establishing new ones.

By identifying Stakeholder(s) and their Requirement(s) the SAF Operational Domain supports the derivation of a complete and consolidated set of Stakeholder Requirement(s) based on operational activities and exchanges.

### Operational Domain Concerns

* Gain a comprehensive understanding of the operating environment that an intended solution needs to support
* Promote the freedom of development by preventing premature commitment to solutions
* Capture all information necessary for subsequent requirement and system architecture definition activities

## Functional Domain

### Functional Domain Objective

The Functional Domain Viewpoints translate Operational Domain usage into the notion of System Function(s) defining the demanded system behavior and quality attributes - performance, safety, security, etc.; the demanded system behavior as it is perceived by the User or other Entity(s) at the System Boundary (known as usage behavior). The result of the elaboration of the viewpoints in the Functional Domain is a comprehensive System Specification.

### Functional Domain Concerns

* Defining the System Boundary
  * identifcation of interaction partners and functional interfaces
* Consolidating Functional Requirement(s): 
  * formally specifying the requirements of the system behavior using a black box approach
* Mastering functional dependency: 
  * detection and resolution of inconsistencies within the Functional Requirement(s) (known as feature interaction)
* Reducing functional complexity: 
  * structuring the functionality from the System's point of view
* Understanding functional interrelationship(s): 
  * collecting and analyzing the exchange between different (sub-)functionality(s)

## Logical Domain

### Logical Domain Objective

The Logical Domain Viewpoints describe the Logical Structure and the distribution of responsibility(s) for the Functionality of the SOI by means of a network of interacting Logical Element(s) that are responsible for a set of desired Function(s). These Logical Element(s) and their Interaction(s) are arranged in the Logical Architecture of the SOI. The structure of the Logical Architecture is in general influenced by nonfunctional criteria, e.g., maintainability, safety, and reliability.

### Logical Domain Concern

* Describing the Internal Logical Structure of the SOI by partitioning the SOI into communicating Logical Element(s)
* Describing the Logical Interface(s) & Data Exchange(s) between the interacting Logical Element(s) in a way that the Logical Interface(s) are independent from their implementation
* Allocating desired Function(s) to cohesive Logical Element(s)
* Supporting the reuse of already existent Logical Element(s) and designing Logical Element(s) such that future reuse is facilitated
* Defining the emerging behavior of the system (in contrast to the partial behavior specified in the of Functional Domain Viewpoints) and enabling a complete simulation of the entire system

## Physical Domain
### Physical Domain Objective
The diagrams generated in the Physical Domain may be used to represent the Product Breakdown Structure, to identify external and internal interfaces, to provide diagrams for the system overview, to support the integration planning, to support production planning and to depict the features and variations implied in the system.

The physical architecture is a combination of re-use elements, COTS elements and make-items for HW as well as for SW. The properties of the selected technical components and their provided resources are identified and modelled.

A major concern of the Physical Domain are the physical interfaces, their identification and definition. For that purpose, the Physical Domain provides the diagrams to model interface with different level of detail considering the actual needs for the point of time in the project life cycle.

For traceability the Physical Domain defines diagrams showing the mapping of the physical items and their interfaces to physical items and their interfaces as well as to applicable requirements.

### Physical Domain Concern
#### Structure
* Show the decomposition of the system into system elements down the hierarch and provide configuration meta data.
#### Interfaces
* Identify external interfaces and the information and data items that are exchanged or transferred via an interface together with related documentation.
* Identify applicable interface standards and allocate the standards to physical interfaces.
* Provide an overview on all physical interfaces of a given element with detailed information on the interfaces.
* Provide an overview on all physical interconnections between the internal elements of the system.
* Provide a detailed view on the physical interfaces and the interconnection between the system elements.
* Define a physical interface type in detail including compatibility rules.
#### Allocations
* Show the allocation of logical blocks from the logical architecture to elements of the physical architecture.
* Show the allocation of logical interfaces from the logical architecture to interfaces of the physical architecture.
* Allocate functional or non-functional requirements to the elements of the physical architecture.
* Allocate functional, non-functional or performance requirements to the interfaces of the physical architecture.
* Allocate a safety criticality to the elements of the physical architecture.
