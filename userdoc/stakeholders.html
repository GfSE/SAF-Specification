The Acquirer may be an organization or an individual acting on behalf of the customer or the user. He is responsible for providing a feasible solution within a given budget. The Acquirer must plan and control the delivery of the system-of-interest as well as other systems together with necessary infrastructure, equipment or training. He must plan the integration of all the procured items to provide a complete solution ready for operation. For large enterprises standardization is an issue. Therefore, the acquirer is interested that standard items are considered in the system architecture.</p> <h2 id="concern"> <a href="#concern" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="concern"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Concern </h2> <ul> <li> <p>Are defined standard items considered in the architecture?</p> </li> <li>For what purpose is the system developed or adapted?
