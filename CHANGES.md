 * Introduce Viewpoint shortcuts. They are intended to used as an easy to remember abbreviation for the longer viewpoint name, e.g.
     **O1_OCXD** for **Operational Context Definition Viewpoint**.
     The Domain and aspect are also encoded in the shortcut.
 * Rename Diagram Stereotypes to use the shortcuts, e.g. **SAF_SLV02a_View** is renamed to **SAF_L2_LSTD**. This removes the redundant "View" and "V", while keeping Domain and Aspect encoding. The Numbering is replaced by the same abbreviation as in the Viewpoint


 * rename some viewpoints for more consistency with other viewpoint names.
    - Operational Context Interaction Viewpoint
    - Operational Capability Definition Viewpoint
    - Logical Structure Definition Viewpoint
    - Physical Structure Definition Viewpoint
    - Stakeholder Requirement Definition Viewpoint
    - System Capability Definition Viewpoint
    - System Requirement Definition Viewpoint
