# SAF User Documentation : Changes
|Date|Change|
|--|--|
|2024-09-06|The use case and system process used in were renamed, in the course of model cleanup of the example.|
|2024-07-29.1|Add example for OCXI, set viewpoint to released.|
|2024-06-30.1|add proposed viewpoints supporting SAF development into new domain "SAF Developement"|
|2024-06-23.1	|add concerns, stakeholders, rationale to justify framework development and specification viewpoints<BR>- SAF Developer, SAF MBSE approach planner, SAF System Model user<BR><BR>revisit change grid definition viewpoint, status now under development.<BR>- it has alternate table representation collecting diagrams conform to viewpoints<BR>- added a concern|
|2024-06-18.1|* all Stereotypes from SCM_Profile are prefixed "SCM_", not "SAF_". |
|2024-06-15.1|* write down naming conventions for table and matrix representations of Viewpoints (postfixed with "_Matrix" and "_Table"<BR>* Rename stereotypes accordingly (SAF_L8_LFUM_Matrix, SAF_O8_OPRM_Table, SAF_F8_SCYM_Table, SAF_O8_OCYM_Table, SAF_F8_SRQT_Matrix, SAF_F6_SRQD_Table, SAF_C7_PRND_Table, SAF_C2_TRMD_Table)<BR>* new, because there is a table representation. They're currently not covered by example : SAF_F3_SSTA_Table, SAF_F3_SPRO_Table, SAF_F2_SDIK_Table, SAF_F1_SUCS_Table, SAF_F1_SCXE_Table, SAF_F1_SCXD_Table<BR>* apply coloring legend to all viewpoint concept and profile diagrams, and redactional corrections<BR>* In Grid Definition Viewpoint, the Implementation of Viewpoint is changed to a user usable SAF_Viewpoint defined by SAF Profile, late  the SAF_Viewpoint in SCM profile will be renamed to SCM_Viewpoint, since it is used to specify SAF, and not to be intendet to be used in system models.<BR>* Add a library of SAF_Viewpoint objects to SAF_Profile to be used to plan modeling using grid Definition VP. The viewpoint objects collect automatically all views(diagrams conform to the Viewpoint)<BR>* SAF_LogicalContextRole did not inherit from part property<BR>* remove exposure of elements related to domain item kinds in SDIK, since It is by no way covered by concerns of VP SDIK. |
|2024-06-12.1|* make internal role stereotypes inherit from part property<BR>* dont expose abstract general physical role, but derived non abstract concepts PFUM and PLOM, partly adressing issue #60<BR>* rename stereotypes for PLOM and PFUM Diagrams to *_Matrix, because the Representation is a matrix.<BR>* logical element role was'nt exposed in PLOM|
|2024-06-07	.1|Argument concept in argumentation assurance viewpoint is no longer abstract, issue #56<BR>Separate network PIEX view, issue #57|
|2024-05-27|shift exposure of abstract concepts (general function, general function usage) to inherited concepts<BR>add missing concept for usage of partial function in system function<BR>fix implementation spec for function usages in functions context (profile not affected)<BR>|
|2024-05-18|add own diagram icons<BR>add a proposed viewpoint for security classifications|
|2024-04-30|fix change stereotype SAF_O1_OCYD to be SAF_O1_OCXD  to be consistent with Operational-Context-Definition shortcut|
|2024-04-26.3| rename some viewpoints for more consistency with other viewpoint names.<BR>    - Operational Context Interaction Viewpoint<BR>    - Operational Capability Definition Viewpoint<BR>    - Logical Structure Definition Viewpoint<BR>    - Physical Structure Definition Viewpoint<BR>    - Stakeholder Requirement Definition Viewpoint<BR>    - System Capability Definition Viewpoint<BR>    - System Requirement Definition Viewpoint|
|2024-04-26.2|Rename Diagram Stereotypes to use the shortcuts, e.g. **SAF_SLV02a_View** is renamed to **SAF_L2_LSTD**. This removes the redundant "View" and "V", while keeping Domain and Aspect encoding. The Numbering is replaced by the same abbreviation as in the Viewpoint.|
|2024-04-26.1| Introduce Viewpoint shortcuts. They are intended to used as an easy to remember abbreviation for the longer viewpoint name, e.g.  **O1_OCXD** for **Operational Context Definition Viewpoint**.  The Domain and aspect are also encoded in the shortcut.<BR> |
