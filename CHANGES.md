|2024-04-26| Introduce Viewpoint shortcuts. They are intended to used as an easy to remember abbreviation for the longer viewpoint name, e.g.  **O1_OCXD** for **Operational Context Definition Viewpoint**.  The Domain and aspect are also encoded in the shortcut.<BR> |
|2024-04-26|Rename Diagram Stereotypes to use the shortcuts, e.g. **SAF_SLV02a_View** is renamed to **SAF_L2_LSTD**. This removes the redundant "View" and "V", while keeping Domain and Aspect encoding. The Numbering is replaced by the same abbreviation as in the Viewpoint.|
