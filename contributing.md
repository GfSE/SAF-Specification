# How to contribute to SAF

The SAF Specification is published as markdown documentation in the SAF-Specification github repository.
It is generated from a model.

## Reporting Issues

Issues should be reported by github issue tracking. It should be stated what the problem is, and a brief solution should be suggested - ideally by a pull request.

## Proposing changes (pull request)

Generally, changes should be proposed by **forking the dev branch** of the SAF-Specification repository and generating a pull request.

The pull request will be reviewed, and when the changes are accepted, they will be incorporated into the model.

A newly model generated specification then can be compared to the merged pull request and it should be the same :)

## Proposing new viewpoints

For new viewpoints, first the existing viewpoints should be reviewed, the concerns might be already covered.

Only when a new viewpoint is required, an existing viewpoint shall serve as a template, and all required VP specification attributes shall be filled out by the viewpoint requestor.

The procedure is the same as proposing a change, but viewpoints require a backing by a conceptual model showing relationships and items to be exposed. This model needs to be discussed with the SAF architects, and synchronized with the existing concepts.

## Developing SAF

The development of SAF involves a number of interrelated elements and concepts.
How SAF is developed is explained in more depth in the article [SAF-Development](developing-saf/development.md)
