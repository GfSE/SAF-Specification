The User provides the usage scenarios, the User needs and finally the user requirements representing most of the functional requirements but also non-functional requirements. The role of User and the role of operator are sometimes allocated, simultaneously or sequentially, to the same individual or organization. All the other stakeholders do not use the system for any purpose, and they do not need or require the system to satisfy any need. Therefore, interests of the User and claims of the Stakeholder could be contradicting.",
