NOTE that a system capability represents the potential to perform an action. In contrast, an operational capability may integrate several physical system capabilities to produce a specific outcome to achieve a mission objective. [Wasson2006, SystemAnalysis+Design+Development]\n2) System Capabilities, as system assets, characterize the mechanical, electrical, optical, or processing features that enable a system to function, process mission resources, make decisions, and achieve a required level of success based on performance. A system capability is broader in scope than simply a functional element (and performance bounding elements), especially in large, complex ecosystems. It represents a physical potential - strength, ability, endurance - to perform an outcome-based action for a given duration under a specified set of operating environment conditions.
