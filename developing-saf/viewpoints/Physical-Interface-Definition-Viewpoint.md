## Purpose
preliminary text - work in progess
The Physical Interface Definition Viewpoint provides definitions for physical interfaces. These definitions are may be reused on different interfaces.
## Applicability
The System Interface Definition Viewpoint supports the "Create System Design " activity included in "Design Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023 [ยง 2.3.5.5] and contributes to the System Interface definition.

It also supports the "Interface Management" method of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023 [ยง 3.2.4].
## Stakeholder
## Concern
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) featuring Physical Interface blocks with ports, and flow properties.
Note: When ports are used these shall be proxy ports and be typed by interface blocks.

A tabular format listing Physical Interface blocks, their ports, and flow properties.
