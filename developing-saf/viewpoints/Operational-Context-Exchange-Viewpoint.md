## Purpose
The Operational Context Exchange Viewpoint provides the Operational Exchange between Operational Performers of information, systems, personnel, energy, etc.
## Applicability
The Operational Context Exchange Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง 4.1] and contributes to the problem or opportunity statement.
## Presentation
An internal block diagram (IBD) - associated to the Operational Context - featuring the interconnected Operational Performers in their respective Operational Role, and the Operational Item Exchange per Operational Connection.

A tabular format listing [tbd].
