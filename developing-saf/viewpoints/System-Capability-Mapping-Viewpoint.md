## Example
![System-Capability-Mapping-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../../diagrams/vp-examples/System-Capability-Mapping-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The System Capability Mapping Viewpoint describes the relationships of System Capabilities. The reasoning for System Capabilities as support for System Use Cases and the contribution of System Processes to Capabilities are described. Furthermore, the mapping of System Capabilities to Operational Capabilities are identified.
## Applicability
The System Capability Mapping Viewpoint supports the "Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition Process" and "System Requirements Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง4.2 & ยง4.3] and contributes to the identification of System Functions, and definition of System Requirements.
## Presentation
A tabular format listing the relationships of System Capabilities to Operational Capabilities, System Use Cases, System Process Activities, and System Requirements.
