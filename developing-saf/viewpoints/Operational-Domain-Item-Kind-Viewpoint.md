## Purpose
The Operational Domain Item Kind Viewpoint captures enterprise wide concepts and collects type definitions for any exchanged item of the Operational Domain. Its purpose is to define these item types and their relationships.
## Applicability
The Operational Domain Item Kind Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง 4.1] and contributes to the problem or opportunity statement.
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) featuring Operational Domain Item Kinds and their relationships.
