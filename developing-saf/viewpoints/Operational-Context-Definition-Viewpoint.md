## Purpose
The Operational Context Definition Viewpoint provides the Operational Contexts, and the involved Operational Performers necessary to support a specific set of Operational Capabilities.
## Applicability
The Operational Context Definition Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง 4.1] and contributes to both the problem or opportunity statement and the Major Stakeholder Identification.
## Stakeholder
* [Acquirer](../../stakeholders.md#Acquirer)
* [System Architect](../../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
## Concern
* What Performers or Resources are necessary to operate the intended solution?
* What is the operational context to achieve an operational story?
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) featuring the identified Operational Performers playing a role in the Operational Context being addressed.
