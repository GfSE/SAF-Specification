## Example
![Operational-Context-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../../diagrams/vp-examples/Operational-Context-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The Operational Context Definition Viewpoint provides the operational contexts and the involved operational performers necessary to support a specific set of operational capabilities.
## Applicability
The Operational Context Definition Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023 [ยง2.3.5.1] and contributes to both the problem or opportunity statement, and the Major Stakeholder Identification.
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) featuring the identified Operational Performers playing a role in the Operational Context being addressed.
