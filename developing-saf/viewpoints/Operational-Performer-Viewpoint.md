## Example
![Operational-Performer-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../../diagrams/vp-examples/Operational-Performer-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The Operational Performer Viewpoint represents the taxonomy of the identified Operational Performers, if existing and relevant for the understanding of the operation of the intended solution. 
## Applicability
The Operational Performer Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง 4.1] and contributes to the problem or opportunity statement.
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) featuring Operational Performers. and their relations in terms of decomposition or generalization at a level of detail required for problem understanding and analysis. 
Note: Identified Stakeholders are related to Operational Performers if appropriate.

## Stakeholder
* [Acquirer](../../stakeholders.md#Acquirer)
* [Customer](../../stakeholders.md#Customer)
* [System Architect](../../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
## Concern
* [What are the relationships between the partys involved in the operation of the intended solution?](../../concerns.md#_2021x_2_8710274_1674576759040_585536_23465)
* [What partys of the organization, enterprise, or operational entity are needed to achieve an intended operational capability?](../../concerns.md#_2021x_2_8710274_1674576759028_333016_23460)
