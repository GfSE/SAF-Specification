## Example
![System-Interface-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../../diagrams/vp-examples/System-Interface-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The System Interface Definition Viewpoint captures system wide concepts defining functional interfaces. It allows to adopt long-lived standards and to harmonize the functional interface definitions to improve interchangeability, interoperability, and portability.
## Applicability
The System Interface Definition Viewpoint supports the "Prepare for Interface Requirement Definition" activity included in "System Requirements Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง 4.3] and contributes to the System Interface definition.
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) featuring System Interface blocks with ports, and flow properties.
Note: When ports are used these shall be proxy ports and be typed by interface blocks.

A tabular format listing System Interface blocks, their ports, and flow properties.
