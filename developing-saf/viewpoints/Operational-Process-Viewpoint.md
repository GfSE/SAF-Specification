## Example
![Operational-Process-Viewpoint-example.svg](../../vp-examples/Operational-Process-Viewpoint-example.svg)
## Purpose
The Operational Process Viewpoint describes the Operational Processes related to a specific Operational Story, the sequence of execution, and their Operational Exchanges, including information, materials, natural resources, etc. The assignment of Operational Processes to Operational Performers is captured.
## Applicability
The Operational Process Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" and the "Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง 4.1, ยง 4.2] and contributes to the definition of operational scenarios.
## Presentation
An activity diagram featuring the ordered execution of Operational Process Actions. Operational Processes may be linked in terms of control flow and/or data flow visualizing the Operational Exchanges needed. 
Note: Operational Process Actions are assigned to Operational Roles and therefore in a more general manner to Operational Performers.

## Stakeholder
* [Acquirer](../../stakeholders.md#Acquirer)
* [Customer](../../stakeholders.md#Customer)
* [System Architect](../../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
## Concern
* What operational process activities shall be executed during the execution of an operational story?
* Which operational activity shall be executed by which operational performer in the operational story?
