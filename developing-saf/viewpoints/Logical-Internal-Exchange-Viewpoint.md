## Example
![Logical-Internal-Exchange-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../../diagrams/vp-examples/Logical-Internal-Exchange-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The Logical Internal Exchange Viewpoint serves for the identification and definition of interfaces of elements of the Logical System. Also, the delegation of System Element Interfaces to the Logical System Boundary Interfaces is covered.
The Logical Internal Exchange Viewpoint
* identifies System Element Interfaces on a Logical Level
* states to which other system elements the interfaces are connected to
* assigns interface specifications to interfaces
* defines the usage of interfaces, e.g., if only a subset of the interfaces is used 
* defines the delegation of System Element Interfaces to the Logical System Boundary Interfaces
## Applicability
The Logical Internal Exchange Viewpoint supports the "Architecture Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023 [ยง2.3.5.4] and contributes to the preliminary interface definition and system architecture description.
## Presentation
One or more IBDs featuring the SOI boundary, the logical elements of the SOI, the connectors for each identified SOI interface delegation to Logical SOI Elements, as well as those connectors between related interfaces of Logical SOI Elements. An interface is a connection resource for hooking on the Logical SOI Elements to other Logical SOI Elements. Item flows are defined for each exchange on the identified interface.
Note: Please use more than one IBD focused on different areas of interest to keep the view comprehensive.
