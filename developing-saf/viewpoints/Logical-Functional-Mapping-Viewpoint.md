## Example
![FFDS Context Definition Mapping of Usage](../../diagrams/FFDS-Context-Definition-Mapping-of-Usage.svg)
## Purpose
The Logical Functional Mapping Viewpoint captures the assignment of the System Functions and the System Partial Functions to the Logical SOI and the Logical SOI Elements.
## Applicability
The Logical Function Mapping Viewpoint supports the "System Architecture Definition process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง 4.4] and contributes to the System Architecture description.
## Stakeholder
* [Hardware Developer](../../stakeholders.md#Hardware-Developer)
* [Software Developer](../../stakeholders.md#Software-Developer)
* [System Architect](../../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
## Concern
* Which (system and system partial) functions are assigned to a logical item and logical item components?
Note: if allocation of usage is used, then allocation of definition is a derived relationship XOR.
## Presentation
A dependency matrix featuring
* the call behavior action representing usage of System Functions or System Partial Functions,
* the part properties representing usage of Logical SOI Elements,
* the allocation relationship between above mentioned elements.
