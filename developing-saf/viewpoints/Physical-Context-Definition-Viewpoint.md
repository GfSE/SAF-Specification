## Example
![Physical-Context-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../../diagrams/vp-examples/Physical-Context-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The Physical Context Definition Viewpoint identifies the various contexts the SOI is used in, along with the associated external entities sharing a physical interface with the system. For each context, the applicable environmental conditions shall be defined. The physical context helps identify the interface requirements needed to integrate a system into its environment in a given context.
## Applicability
The Physical Context Definition Viewpoint supports the "Design Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023 [ยง2.3.5.5] and contributes to the artifacts "System Design Description" and "System Interface Definition".
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) depicting the elements available in a specific context. At least one BDD is used per identified context featuring
* one block representing the Physical System, i.e., the system of interest
* one block representing the specific Physical System Context
* several blocks representing Physical Context Elements such as Physical User, Physical External System, and Physical Environment that are present in the Physical System Context
* composition relationships attaching the Physical Context Elements and the Physical System to the Physical System Context block

* [Which are the given contexts the system is embedded and utilized in?](../../concerns.md#_2021x_2_8710274_1674576758891_776196_23368)
* [Which interface partners does the system have?](../../concerns.md#_2021x_2_8710274_1674576759091_673143_23507)
