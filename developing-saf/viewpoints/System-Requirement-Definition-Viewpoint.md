## Example
![System-Requirement-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../../diagrams/vp-examples/System-Requirement-Definition-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The System Requirement Definition Viewpoint specifies functions, non-functional properties, or constraints of the System. System Requirements are captured, the interrelationships between Functional and Non-Functional Requirements on the same level of abstraction and the traceability to Stakeholder Requirements are depicted.
## Applicability
The System Requirement Definition Viewpoint supports the "System Requirements Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2015 [ยง4.3] and contributes to the System Requirements Verification and Traceability Matrix (RVTM).
## Presentation
A tabular format listing
* unique requirement ID, text, and attributes,
* traceability reference to Stakeholder Requirements,
* traceability reference to depended Requirements on the same level of abstraction.

## Stakeholder
* [Hardware Developer](../../stakeholders.md#Hardware-Developer)
* [IV&V Engineer](../../stakeholders.md#IV&V-Engineer)
* [Project Manager](../../stakeholders.md#Project-Manager)
* [Software Developer](../../stakeholders.md#Software-Developer)
* [System Architect](../../stakeholders.md#System-Architect)
## Concern
* [What are the exchange requirements imposed on the system?](../../concerns.md#_2021x_2_8710274_1674576758978_464279_23425)
* [What are the functional requirements imposed on the system?](../../concerns.md#_2021x_2_8710274_1674576758860_195868_23350)
* [What are the non-functional requirements imposed on the system?](../../concerns.md#_2021x_2_8710274_1674576758640_180559_23118)
* [What are the requirements of environmental conditions imposed on the system?](../../concerns.md#_2021x_2_8710274_1674576758798_122991_23285)
* [What is the range of acceptable system performance, i.e. the critical, top-level performance requirements derived from the operational needs?](../../concerns.md#_2021x_2_8710274_1674576759042_480392_23467)
* [Which System Requirements are derived from Stakeholder Requirements?](../../concerns.md#_2021x_2_8710274_1674576758563_692887_23057)
* [Which are the interface requirements imposed on the system?](../../concerns.md#_2021x_2_8710274_1674576758778_979635_23258)
