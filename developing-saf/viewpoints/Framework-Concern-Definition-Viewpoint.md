## Purpose
The Framework Concern Definition Viewpoint allows to express the information need of Architecture Stakeholders by the definition of Concerns. The Concerns are related to stakeholders by a rationale and framed by Viewpoints.

The viewpoint is intended to be used for development or extension of the SAF.

## Applicability
The Viewpoint supports the definition of  "Stakeholders and concerns",  and  "Specification of an architecture description framework" as defined in ISO42010:2022
## Presentation
A table featuring the SCM_VPConcerns elements of the SAF, and their relations to SCM_Viewpoints and SCM_VPStakeholders
