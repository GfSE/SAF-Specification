## Example
![Stakeholder-Identification-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg](../../diagrams/vp-examples/Stakeholder-Identification-Viewpoint-primary-example.svg)
## Purpose
The Stakeholder Identification Viewpoint of the operational domain strives to identify Stakeholders, whose needs shall be considered during the operation of the intended solution and the execution of the operational processes to support the identified operational capabilities. 
A Stakeholder identification is distinguishing which parties are classified as Stakeholders in a project, either because they can influence the project or because they are directly affected by the result. A Stakeholder analysis is a process of analyzing individuals, teams, or organizations throughout the project life cycle, grouping them according to their levels of participation, interest, and influence in the project, and determining how best to involve and communicate with each of these Stakeholder groups throughout. During the realization of the Intended Solution additional Stakeholders shall be identified having additional needs and requirements, e.g., regarding production of system elements or certain technologies.
## Applicability
The Stakeholder Identification Viewpoint supports the "Business or Mission Analysis Process" and the "Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition Process" activities of the INCOSE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING HANDBOOK 2023 [ยง2.3.5.1, ยง2.3.5.2] and contributes to the major Stakeholder identification.
## Presentation
A block definition diagram (BDD) depicting the identified, analysed, and classified Stakeholders and their relations to the Intended Solution.
