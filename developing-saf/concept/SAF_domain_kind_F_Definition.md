|Concept|Documentation|
| --- | --- |
| General Functional Parameter | A parameter of a System or Context Function.|
| Logical Interaction Point Property | Specifies a detail of an interaction point on Logical Level.|
| Logical Item Exchange | Specifies the exchange that is to take place on a connection of two interaction points on Logical Level.|
| Operational Domain Kind | Specifies the kind of Operational Item Exchange between Operational Context Roles or Operational Processes.|
| PEKrealizingSDK | Specifies the fact that a System Domain Kind is realized by Physical Exchange Kinds.|
| Physical Exchange Kind | Specification for any kind of physical item (energy, material, information, etc.) to be exchanged on Physical Level. This is the realization of the specification made by System Domain Kinds.|
| SDKbeeingInSSE | Specifies that a System Domain Kind can have certain states.<br>Note:<br>Of course an item is in only one distinct state at a certain time. The multiplicity means that an Item can have a set of possible states, and a state can be used to specify possible States for several domain items.|
| SDKderivingFromODK | Specifies the fact that a System Domain Kind on system level is derived from an Operational Domain Kind.|
| SDKtypingFPM | Specifies the fact that a System Domain Kind defines the type of a Function Parameter.|
| SDKtypingLIE | Specifies the fact that a System Domain Kind defines the type of a Logical Item Exchange.|
| SDKtypingLIPP | Specifies the fact that a System Domain Kind defines the type of a Logical Interaction Point Property.|
| System Domain Kind | Specification for any kind of conceptual item (energy, material, information, etc.) to be exchanged on Functional or Logical Level. The System Domain Kind is agnostic to any realization on Physical Level.|
| System State | Describes a state (or mode) of something that can have distinct states.|
