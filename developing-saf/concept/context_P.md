| LENconceptingPEN | Specifies the fact that a logical Environment Entity is a concept for a Physical Environment Entity.|
| LESconceptingPES | Specifies that the Logical System is a concept for a Physical System.|
| LURconceptingPUR | Specifies that the Logical user is a concept for a Physical User.|
| Logical Environment | A Logical Environment in the Logical Domain, outside the SOI scope, interacting with the SOI. E.g., air, dirt, sun, road.|
