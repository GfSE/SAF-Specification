|Concept|Documentation|
| --- | --- |
| Abstract Physical Element | Abstract element representing physical structure items keeping properties and relations applicable to all physical items.|
| Hardware Element | Pure Hardware Elements. Similarity to the V-Model "hardware unit".|
| PCAappliesToPIC | specifies that a Physical Compatibility Assertion shall apply to an Physical Interface Connection|
| PCAassertsCompatibiltyForPICD | specifies the Physical Interface Connection Point definitions the Physical Compatibility Assertion is valid for.|
| PEKtypingPIE | Specifies the fact that a Physical Exchange Kind defines the type of a Physical Item Exchange.|
| PEKtypingPIP | Specifies the fact that a Physical Exchange Kind defines the type of a Physical Interface  Property.|
| PICDdefiningPICP | Specifies the fact that a Physical Interface Connection Point Definition defines an Physical Interface Connection Point.|
| PICPapplyingToPCE | Specifies the fact that a Physical Interface Connection Point applies to a Physical Context Element.|
| PICPapplyingToPET | Specifies the fact that a Physical Interface Connection Point applies to a Physical Element.|
| PICallowingPIE | Specifies the fact that a Physical Item Exchange is allowed on the Physical Interface Connection.|
| PIPspecifyingDetailOfPICD | Specifies the fact that a Physical Interface Property is a detail of a Physical Interface Connection Definition.|
| Physical Compatibility Assertion | specifies that two interface connection point definitions are compatible, and how the Physical interface properties are mapped.|
| Physical Context Element | Abstract element of a System Context  in the Physical Domain, outside the SOI scope, interacting with the SOI.|
| Physical Element | A composition of Hardware Elements and Software Elements. Similarity to the V-Model segments and system. See [VXT].|
| Physical Environment | The Environmental Element in the Physical Domain, outside the SOI scope, interacting with the SOI. E.g. air, dirt, sun, road.|
| Physical Exchange Kind | Specifies the Physical Level realization of a System Domain Kind. It is both used to define exchange on Physical Interfaces.|
| Physical External System | The External System in the Physical Domain, outside the SOI scope, interacting with the SOI. E.g. power grid, mobile network, fresh water system (in a house).|
| Physical Interface Connection | Specifies the connection of two interface connection points on Physical Level, necessary for any exchange to happen.|
| Physical Interface Connection Point | Specifies the existence of an interaction point on Physical Level.|
| Physical Interface Connection Point Definition | Defines the exchange capabilities of an interaction point on Physical Level.|
| Physical Interface Property | Specifies a detail of an interaction point on Physical Level.|
| Physical Item Exchange | Specifies the exchange that is supposed to happen on a Physical Interface Connection.|
| Physical SOI | Represents the SOI in the Physical Domain.|
| Physical User | The Physical User is the representation for a human in the physical domain, outside the SOI scope, interacting with the SOI.|
| Software Element | Pure Software Elements. Similarity to the V-Model "software unit".|
