| --- | --- |
| LICDSspecifyingDetailOfLICP | Specifies the fact that a Logical Interface Connection Definition is a detail of a Logical Interface Connection Point.|
| LICPapplyingToLCE | Specifies the fact that a Logical Interface Connection Point applies to a Logical Context Element.|
| LICPapplyingToLET | Specifies the fact that a Logical Interface Connection Point applies to a Logical Element.|
| LICallowingLIE | Specifies the fact that a Logical Item Exchange is allowed on the Logical Interface Connection.|
| LIPspecifyingDetailOfLICD | Specifies the fact that a Logical Interface Property is a detail of a Logical Interface Connection Definition.|
| Logical Context Element | Abstract element of a System Context in the Logical Domain, outside the SOI scope, interacting with the SOI.|
| Logical Element | Describes a logical, conceptual system as specification for an implementation of a system, or system part.|
| Logical Environment | An Environmental Element in the Logical Domain, outside the SOI scope, interacting with the SOI. E.g., air, dirt, sun, road.|
| Logical External System | An External System in the Logical Domain, outside the SOI scope, interacting with the SOI. E.g., power grid, mobile network, fresh water system (in a house).|
| Logical Interface Connection | Specifies the connection of two interface connection points on Logical Level.|
| Logical Interface Connection Point | Specifies the existence of an interaction point on Logical Level.|
| Logical Interface Connection Point Definition | Specifies a certain kind of an interaction point on Logical Level.|
| Logical Interface Property | Specifies a detail of an interaction point on a Logical Level.|
| Logical Item Exchange | Specifies the exchange that is supposed to happen on a Logical Interface Connection.|
| Logical SOI | A SOI representation in the Logical Domain.|
| Logical User | A human representation in the Logical Domain, outside the SOI scope, interacting with the SOI.|
| SDKtypingLIE | Specifies the fact that a System Domain Kind defines the type of a Logical Item Exchange.|
| SDKtypingLIP | Specifies the fact that a System Domain Kind defines the type of a Logical Interface Exchange Property.|
| System Domain Kind | Specification for any kind of exchange on Functional, and Logical Level, focus on what kind of information is exchanged (information, material, energy).The Domain Item Kind is agnostic to any Physical realization.|
