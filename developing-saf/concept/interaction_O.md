| OIScontainingOCM | Specifies the fact that an Operational Interaction Scenario contains one or more Operational Chronological Messages.|
| OISrefiningOSY | Specifies the fact that an Operational Story is refined by one or more Operational Interaction Scenarios.|
| Operational Chronological Message | Ordered sequential occurrence of exchanges between Operational Interaction Scenario Participants.|
| Operational Context | An Operational Context is representing a separate Usage Scenario with a specific configuration of Operational Performers, these are interacting in the Scenario exhibiting a specific identified Operational Capability.

An Operational Performer may be any kind of organization, person, or even a system playing a role in one or more Operational Contexts.<br><br>Aliases:<br>UAF::OperationalPerformer|
| Operational Scenario Participation | Specifies the fact that an Operational Context Role participates in an Operational Interaction Scenario.|
