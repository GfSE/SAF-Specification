|Concept|Documentation|
| --- | --- |
| OPRactingInOSY | Specifies the fact that an Operational Performer acts in an Operational Story.|
| OPRcapableOFperformingOPS | Specifies the fact that an Operational Performer performs an Operational Activity. Traceability from Operational Activities to Operational Performers is derived via assignment of Operational Action to Operational Roles.<br><br>Aliases:<br>UAF::IsCapableToPerform|
| OPRcomposedOF | Specifies the fact that an Operational Performer consists of one or more Operational Performers.|
| OPRexhibitingOCY | Specifies the fact that an Operational Performer exhibits an Operational Capability under specific environmental conditions.|
| OSYtakingPlaceInOCT | Specifies the fact that an Operational Story occurs in a certain Operational Context. <br>Note: When parts of an Operational Story do occur in several contexts, they shall be duplicated.|
| Operational Capability | A Operational Capability is a high-level description or specification of an organizational unit's ability to execute a specified course of action, to implement a business process or to provide a service. Operational Capabilities typically require people, processes, infrastructure, technology and supporting systems to be implemented.  A Operational Capability is an enduring element, its implementation may change over time. A necessary or desired change of a Operational Capability triggers the updated of involved systems or the integration new systems.<br><br>Aliases:<br>UAF::Capability<br>NAF4::Capability|
| Operational Context | An Operational Context is representing a separate Usage Scenario with a specific configuration of Operational Performers, these are interacting in the Scenario exhibiting a specific identified Operational Capability. One or more Operational Contexts meaningful for the Operational Domain are to be identified. <br><br>Aliases:<br>UAF::HighLevelOperationalConcept|
| Operational Context Role | An Operational Context Role represents a participant in an Operational context.<br>It is interacting with other roles of the given Operational Context. Specific characteristics and features or, in case of persons or organizational units, knowledge and skills are assigned to a role necessary for the execution of the performed Operational Processes.|
| Operational Performer | An Operational Performer is an element of the Operational Context that is capable to perform Operational Process Activities contributing to a specific identified Operational Capability. An Operational Performer may be any kind of organization, person, or even a system playing a role in one or more Operational Contexts.<br><br>Aliases:<br>UAF::OperationalPerformer|
| Operational Process | An Operational Process captures activity-based operational behavior including scenarios, activity actions, and operational exchange flows, e.g., including information, materials, natural resources, etc.<br><br>Aliases:<br>UAF::Operational Activity<br>NAF::Logical Activity|
| Operational Story | The Operational Story represents one or more Operational Use Cases in the Usage Scenario identified by the Operational Context. The Operational Story is described as narrative story-telling.|
| SCEactingForOPR | Specifies the fact that a System Context Element is acting for the benefit of an Operational Performer.|
| SCErepresentedBySSH | Specifies the fact that a System Context Element is represented by a SOI Stakeholder.|
| SOIactingForOPR | Specifies the fact that a SOI is acting for the benefit of an Operational Performer.|
| SSHrepresentingOPR | Specifies the fact that a SOI Stakeholder is representing an Operational Performer.|
| System Context Element | An abstract element representing a System Context Element. Base class for specific kinds of Context Elements.|
| System Of Interest | An abstract element representing a SOI. Base class for specific kinds of SOIs.|
| System of Interest Stakeholder | An individual, team, or organization (or classes thereof) with interests in, or concerns relative to, a system. It may be involved in any life cycle phase of the System. The Stakeholder represents a class or kind of Stakeholders. Stakeholders have a certain involvement: Stakeholder Involvement captures the influence of a project specific Stakeholder on the System. Stakeholder Involvement is characterized by<br>* Contact Person<br>* Kind of involvement<br>* Life Cycle Phases involved<br>* Relevance decision if and up to which degree Stakeholder is considered<br>* Rationale for decision when Stakeholder is not considered|
