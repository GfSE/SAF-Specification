|Concept|Documentation|
| --- | --- |
| OPRactingInOSY | Specifies the fact that an Operational Performer acts in an Operational Story.|
| OPRcapableOFperformingOPS | Specifies the fact that an Operational Performer performs an Operational Activity. Traceability from Operational Activities to Operational Performers is derived via assignment of Operational Action to Operational Roles.<br><br>Aliases:<br>UAF::IsCapableToPerform|
| OPRcomposedOF | Specifies the fact that an Operational Performer consists of one or more Operational Performers.|
| OPRexhibitingOCY | Specifies the fact that an Operational Performer exhibits an Operational Capability under specific environmental conditions.|
| OSYtakingPlaceIN | Specifies the fact that an Operational Story happens in a certain Operational Context. When parts of an Operational Story do happen in several contexts, they shall be duplicated.|
| Operational Capability | A Operational Capability is a high-level description or specification of an organizational unit's ability to execute a specified course of action, to implement a business process or to provide a service. Operational Capabilities typically require people, processes, infrastructure, technology and supporting systems to be implemented.  A Operational Capability is an enduring element, its implementation may change over time. A necessary or desired change of a Operational Capability triggers the updated of involved systems or the integration new systems.<br><br>Aliases:<br>UAF::Capability<br>NAF4::Capability|
| Operational Context | An Operational Context is representing a separate Usage Scenario with a specific configuration of Operational Performers, these are interacting in the Scenario exhibiting a specific identified Operational Capability. One or more Operational Contexts meaningful for the Operational Domain are to be identified. <br><br>Aliases:<br>UAF::HighLevelOperationalConcept|
| Operational Context Performer Constituent | An Operational Context Constituent represents a participant in the Operational Activity executing one or more of its atomic actions interacting with other constituents of the identified Operational Context. Specific characteristics and features or, in case of persons or organizational units, knowledge and skills are assigned to a constituent necessary for the execution of the allocated actions.|
| Operational Performer | An Operational Performer is an element of the Operational Context that is capable to perform Operational Process Activities contributing to a specific identified Operational Capability. An Operational Performer may be any kind of organization, person, or even a system playing a role in one or more Operational Contexts.<br><br>Aliases:<br>UAF::OperationalPerformer|
| Operational Process | An Operational Process captures operational behaviors including scenarios, activity actions, and operational exchanges including information, materials, natural resources, etc.<br><br>Aliases:<br>UAF::Operational Activity<br>NAF::Logical Activity|
| Operational Story | The Operational Story represents one or more Operational Use Cases in the Usage Scenario identified by the Operational Context. The Operational Story is described as narrative story-telling.|
| SCEactingForOPR | Specifies the fact that a System Context Element is acting for the benefit of an Operational Performer.|
| SOIactingForOPR | Specifies the fact that a SOI is acting for the benefit of an Operational Performer.|
| SSHrepresentingOPR | Specifies the fact that a SOI Stakeholder represents an Operational Performer.|
| SSHrepresentingSCE | Specifies the fact that a SOI Stakeholder represents a System Context Element.|
| System Context Element | An abstract element of the SOI context. Base class for specific kinds of context elements.|
| System Of Interest | An abstract element representing the SOI. Base for specific perspectives on SOI (logical , physical)|
| System of Interest Stakeholder | An individual, team, or organization (or classes thereof) with interests in, or concerns relative to, a system. It may be involved in any life cycle phase of the System. The Stakeholder represents a class or kind of Stakeholders. Stakeholders also have a certain Involvement: Stakeholder involvement captures the influence of a project specific Stakeholder on the System. Stakeholder Involvement is characterized by<br>* Contact Person<br>* Kind of involvement<br>* Life Cycle Phases involved<br>* Relevance decision if and up to which degree Stakeholder is considered<br>* Rationale for decision if Stakeholder is not considered|
