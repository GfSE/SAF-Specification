| Operational Context | An Operational Context is representing a separate Usage Scenario with a specific configuration of Operational Performers, these are interacting in the Scenario exhibiting a specific identified Operational Capability. One or more Operational Contexts meaningful for the Operational Domain are to be identified. <br><br>Aliases:<br>UAF::HighLevelOperationalConcept|
| Operational Context Role | An Operational Context Role represents a participant in an Operational context.<br>It is interacting with other roles of the given Operational Context. Specific characteristics and features or, in case of persons or organizational units, knowledge and skills are assigned to a role necessary for the execution of the performed Operational Processes.|
| Operational Performer | An Operational Performer is an element of the Operational Context that is capable to perform Operational Process Activities contributing to a specific identified Operational Capability. An Operational Performer may be any kind of organization, person, or even a system playing a role in one or more Operational Contexts.<br><br>Aliases:<br>UAF::OperationalPerformer|
| Physical Context Element | Abstract element of a System Context on Physical Level, outside the SOI scope, interacting with the SOI.|
| Physical Context Element Role | Specifies the fact that a Physical Context Element exists in a given Physical System Context.|
