|Concept|Documentation|
| --- | --- |
| Aspect | Aspects capture a set of characteristics or features of the Entity of Interest in its Environment to address Concerns within an Architecture Description.|
| Concern | Specifies an information need that a stakeholder of the SAF needs to be satisfied within an MBSE approach using SAF.|
| Domain | Domain captures viewpoints that belong together within typical SE workflow stages.|
| GDcontainingAT | Specifies that the grid is composed of several aspects.|
| GDcontainingDN | Specifies that the grid is composed of several domains.|
| GDcontainingVP | Specifies that the grid contains multiple viewpoints|
| Grid | The grid manages the viewpoints in grid cells assigned to the categories of an domain (row) and an aspect (column).|
| PIimplementsSEC | specifies that a stereotype from the SAF profile implements a concept|
| ProfileItem | |
| Rationale | Specifies why a stakeholder has a concern. Typically that has to do with the work a stakeholder has to do within an MBSE approach.|
| SAF Stereotype | A stereotype of the SAF Profile Model|
| SE Concept | specifies a SE concept to be supported by SAF|
| SECisProvidedByVP | Specifies, that one or more SE Concepts are provided by the Viewpoints Views|
| SECrelatesToSEC | specifies a relationship of a concept to an other.|
| SSTimplementsVP | specifies, that one ore more SAF Stereotypes implement a viewpoint.<br>Note: Multiple Stereotypes are used if there are alternate presentations.|
| Stakeholder | specifies someone (typically a role) having an information need within an MBSE approach. |
| SysML Stereotype | A stereotype from sysml|
| UML Metaclass | A metaclass from UML|
| VPbelongingToAT | specifies that a viewpoint belongs to one aspect.|
| VPbelongingToDN | specifies that a viewpoint belongs to one domain.|
| VPframesCN | Specifies that a Viewpoint frames one or more concerns. That means that the views conform to that viewpoint satisfy the information need expressed by the concerns.|
| VWconformingToVP | specifies that a view conforms to a viewpoint.|
| View | A architecture view comprises portion of an architecture description and addresses information-relevant concerns framed by a architecture viewpoint.|
| Viewpoint | A architecture viewpoint defines set of conventions for the creation, interpretation and use of an architecture view to frame one or more concerns|
